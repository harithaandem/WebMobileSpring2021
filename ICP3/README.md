<h1>BOOTSTRAP AND JAVASCRIPT</h1>

<p> This ICP contains two tasks, building responsive web design and Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.</p>

<h3>TASK 1:</h3>

<p> Using Java Script I have built ROCK-PAPER_SCISSORS Game. Only one user can play a game with system. The scores will be updated for both the user and system</p>

<p> The images are displayed based on the selection by the user.</p>

<h3> TASK 2:</h3>

<p> Using bootstrap I have developed a responsive web design. Bootstrap provides very good feature that divides the rows into cols. </p>

<p> This webpage fits its content to the size of the device. This makes the user interface look good.</p>
