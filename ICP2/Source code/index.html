                    American football, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada and also known as
                    gridiron,[nb
                    1] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at
                    each end.
                    The
                    offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by
                    running
                    with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to
                    stop the
                    offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least
                    ten
                    yards in
                    four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed,
                    they are
                    given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the
                    ball into
                    the
                    opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a
                    field
                    goal.
                    The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.

                    The introduction of the snap resulted in an unexpected consequence. Prior to the snap, the strategy
                    had
                    been
                    to
                    punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that
                    as
                    the
                    snap
                    was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring.
                    In
                    1881,
                    in a
                    game between Yale and Princeton, both teams used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records.
                    Each
                    team
                    held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0–0 tie. This "block game"
                    proved
                    extremely
                    unpopular with both teams' spectators and fans.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum
                    was
                    considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three
                    downs, or
                    tackles, to advance the ball 5 yards (4.6 m). Failure to advance the ball the required distance
                    within
                    those
                    three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change
                    effectively
                    made
                    American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field
                    to
                    measure
                    distances made it resemble a gridiron in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction
                    of
                    the
                    field
                    size to 110 by 53 1⁄3 yards (100.6 m × 48.8 m) and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded
                    four
                    points
                    for
                    a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown, and five for a goal from the field.
                    Additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized,[13] and a static line of scrimmage was
                    instituted.
